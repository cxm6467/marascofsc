              														<p>FSMA has been signed into law. Its focus is on the prevention of food illness. Food companies will be required to have a food safety plan in place that meets the FSMA requirements. The plan needs to be developed by a Preventive Controls Qualified Individual (PCQI).</p>
                                          <p>The Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (referred to as the Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation) is intended to ensure safe manufacturing/processing, packing and holding of food products for human consumption in the United States.</p>
                                          <p>This course, developed by FSPCA, is the “standardized curriculum” recognized by FDA; successfully completing this course is one way to meet the requirements for a PCQI.</p> 
                                          <p>To becoming qualified as a PCQI you need to take the standardized training course taught by a "Preventive Controls Lead Instructor". This is an instructor that has applied to FSPCA, been accepted and completed the Lead Instructor training course.</p>
                                          <p>I am a Lead Instructor for the FSPCA Preventive Controls for Human Food Course authorized to teach this standardized course, and will be offering the 2.5 day Preventive Controls for Human Food Course.</p>

      <h3>On-Site Courses and Training</h3>
      <h4>Training at Your Location</h4><b>Delivered in a controlled environment:</b>
											<p>Having training delivered conveniently to your work-site maintains the
											confidentiality of your systems and processes and enables the learning to be relevant to
											your workplace context. This strategy is particularly beneficial if you are seeking to
											review and improve on your operation and management systems. Training employees on-site
											enhances their learning capability by focusing on developing skills that are relevant to
											their work role. On-site delivery supports better transfer of knowledge and skills to
											the workplace.</p><b>Build on team dynamics:</b>
											<p>By drawing on the experiences of team members and engaging in structured professional
											conversations, your employees become more receptive towards change and embracing new
											initiatives. Reduced expenses: Save on travel and accommodation expenses and minimize
											the downtime involved with training employees off-site.</p><b>Greater information
											retention:</b>
											<p>One of the most fundamental methodologies in effective adult learning is team
											interaction. Review of learning through interactive discussions between participants
											after the completion of formal training is encouraged by our facilitators to enhance
											learning outcomes.</p><b>Request for Onsite Training Quote Onsite training at your
											company's location is an excellent option for 5 or more attendees:</b>
